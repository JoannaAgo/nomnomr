I mean yeah, food delivery apps are cool, but have you ever been in a large group of people trying to find what to order while being extremely hungry?
I have and I think I'm on safe ground saying that it really isn't pleasant.
There are 4 major dangers when it comes to ordering food online while having company:

1. The ✨I N D E C I S I V E N E S S✨: Oh to be young and have so many options.  
-Pizza?  
-I love cheese.  
-Souvlaki?  
-I mean duh? Is that even a question?  
-Well, I'd probably dig some burittos rignt now.  
-Me freaking too!  
Okay, then... Decide! What is wrong with you people? 

2. The ✨C A S H or C A R D?✨: I can't pay for the whole order with my card. You can't either.
And you, in the back. You only have cash on you? It's 2022! 

3. The ✨P I C K I N E S S✨: Did you know that over 26% of teenage and adult Americans identify as picky eaters?
Well, now you do. That being said, in a group of 5 people, 1.3 of them is gonna be mortal enemies to broccoli, soy sauce or even bacon.
So imagine trying to satisfy one of those. I mean go get an item from the kid's menu for all i care.  
AND I'M PRETTY UNBOTHERED TO YOUR LACTOSE INTOLERANCE, GIANNY. 

and last but not least,

4. The ✨P E O P L E  P L E A S I N G✨: You know, exactly what I'm talking about.
I'm right here asking you what. would. you. like. to. eat. right. now? "Whatever you want" isn't an option.
I won't be the one deciding for all of you every Saturday night. You have to take initiative for once and you are gonna be heard. 
 
So, here's the deal. We are about to solve all those problems with one cute little app.
Nomnomr.

Nomnomr is here to help all those indecisive people choose the categories and shops they want to eat from, while finding the golden ratio between them.

Choose between cash or credit? Can you lend me some cash? Well, my kebab was 4euros and now I have to pay 2.50 for the transfer fee. 
No more. With nomnomr you can pick whatever form of payment you want without breaking a sweat over who owes to who.

Picky eaters? Well, it's your lucky day. You can see all the food items before selecting a shop and you can always choose whichever restaurant suits your taste.

And you people pleasers. It's your time to shine. You can nominate your likes and dislikes. And no one will know who did it. Your vote is equal to everyone's.

An app for the nights when you wanna kill your friends. "nomnomr" offers tools that you and your friends can use, so that group food orders (a nightmare from the past) are fast and enjoyable. Agree on Food Categories, choose which Restaurant (or Restaurants) you will order from with swipes and Split the Bill, all in one app. Why isn't this a thing already you may ask... Well, we felt the same, so we made it. And now... "there is an app for that!"
